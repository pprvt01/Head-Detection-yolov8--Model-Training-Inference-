# Head Detection using YOLOv8 

This project implements a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for **head detection** in video frames. The model can count people in a video by detecting heads, even in crowded scenes.

## Dataset

- The dataset was created using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
- Includes images with head annotations for object detection.
- YOLO format was used for labels.

### Example Labels:
```
<cls_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
```

---

## How to Run Inference

### 1. Python Script (`inference.py`)
```bash
python inference.py --model yolov8s.pt --source input_video.mp4
```

### 2. Jupyter Notebook
- Open `Head Detection.ipynb`
- Run all cells to test the model on images or video.

---

## Model

- **Model**: YOLOv8-small (`yolov8s`)
- **Framework**: [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Trained using Google Colab with Roboflow dataset

---

## Requirements

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

---

## Example Results

- Supports counting people in surveillance or crowd footage
- Works in real-time video processing

---

## License

This project is open-source and free to use under the [MIT License](LICENSE).


## Updates

### May 2025

- Added `cctv_images/` folder containing real-world CCTV frames for head detection.
- Added `cctv_labels/` with annotated labels corresponding to the CCTV images (YOLO format).
- Uploaded new trained YOLOv8 model `new_best.pt` with improved performance on real CCTV data.
